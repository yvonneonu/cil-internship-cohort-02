 # **Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model**

The Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model is a theoretical structure that portrays systems administration or media communications frameworks as seven layers, each with its own capacity.

The layers assist with systems administration professionals picture what is happening inside their organizations and can assist with systems administration administrators limit issues (Is it an actual issue or something with the application?), just as software engineers (when fostering an application, which different layers does it have to work with?). Tech merchants selling new items will regularly allude to the OSI model to assist clients with understanding which layer their items work with or regardless of whether it works "across the stack".



# **There 7 layers of the OSI model**

The layers are: Layer 1—Physical; Layer 2—Data Link; Layer 3—Network; Layer 4—Transport; Layer 5—Session; Layer 6—Presentation; Layer 7—Application.



- **Layer 1 - Physical**

At the lower part of our OSI model we have the Physical Layer, which addresses the electrical and actual portrayal of the framework. This can incorporate everything from the link type, radio recurrence interface (as in a Wi-Fi organization), just as the design of pins, voltages, and other actual necessities. At the point when a systems administration issue happens, many systems administration experts go right to the actual layer to make sure that each of the links are appropriately associated and that the power plug hasn't been pulled from the switch, switch or PC

- **Layer 2 - Data Link**

The Data Link Layer gives hub to-hub information move (between two straightforwardly associated hubs), and furthermore handles blunder remedy from the actual layer. Two sublayers exist here too - the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. In the systems administration world, most switches work at Layer 2. In any case, it is quite difficult. A few switches additionally work at Layer 3 to help virtual LANs that might traverse more than one switch subnet, which requires directing capacities.

- **Layer 3 - Network**

Here at the Network Layer is where you’ll find most of the router functionality that most networking professionals care about and love. In its most basic sense, this layer is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through different routers.

- **Layer 4 – Transport**

The Transport Layer deals with the coordination of the data transfer between end systems and hosts. How much data to send, at what rate, where it goes, etc. The best known example of the Transport Layer is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), commonly known as TCP/IP. TCP and UDP port numbers work at Layer 4, while IP addresses work at Layer 3, the Network Layer.
